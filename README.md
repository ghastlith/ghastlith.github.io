My personal webpage, a place where you can find my social media profiles.

The website is made with Svelte, a component framework, and SvelteKit, an UI framework built on Svelte.

To setup a new environment, first of all install NodeJS version 24, and then simply install the node depedencies and run the application.

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

As for deploying to GitHub pages, run the _deploy_ command.

```sh
npm i
npm run deploy
```
